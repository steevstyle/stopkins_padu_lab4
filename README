NOTE: for the video, it's not obvious but we ran the suggested "for loop" provided in the lab to iterate through Hz values.
I modified the watch command to update every .2 seconds, ending the command with "&"...
Then, while watching the output, I pasted the command to loop/write Hz values to /dev/mytimer

RESOURCES:

claude.ai
	- helped with implementing debouncing on the interrupts...but probably could have been handled with internal gpio functions
	- helped with identifying and fixing a problem with ped_cycle_count where 1 red cycle occurred before red+yellow configureation
	- helped with identifying a problem with the character device (I made a typo and hardcoded the wrong major namumber)
	- helped fix syntax for mytimer_read and mytimer_write declarations (and helped find a missing bracket or two)
